This script takes either a Panorama URL or Panorama configuration XML as input as well as device-group name and returns the security rulebase as an Excel spreadsheet with all address and service objects resolved. A sample [Panorama configuration file](tests/get_config_panorama.xml) is included, though you are encouraged to work with your own configuration when testing and extending the script!

## PANOS Compatibility:
Our script currently only supports configuration that meets the following:
 - maximum file size of 32MB
 - PANOS 7.0, 7.1, and 8.0
 - Panorama configurations (no FW support)
 - The security rules must be configured in the Post-rulebase

Not currently supported:
 - NAT rules are not supported
 - Stand-alone firewalls are not supported
 - Shared and pre-rulebase rules are not supported

## Requirements
- xmltodict
- requests
- pytest
- flask
- flask-excel
- pyexcel-xlsx


## Usage

The current recommended usage for this script is via a docker container. You can build your own via the included Dockerfile:
```bash
docker build -t bilalbox/panos_rule_exporter .
```

Or you can pull the pre-built container from docker hub:
```bash
docker pull bilalbox/panos_rule_exporter
```

Then run the container via:
```bash
docker run -i -t -p 5000:5000 --name=test bilalbox/panos_rule_exporter:latest
```
Once the container is running, navigate to the docker host IP address at http://{docker-host}:5000 and you will be able to use the web interface to upload configurations and export firewall policy.
